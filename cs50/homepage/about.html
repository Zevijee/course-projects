            About the creator
        </h1>
        <h3 class="text-center">
            My story began long ago when my parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, were tragically killed in an alley in downtown Gotham City. As a young boy, I was determined to avenge their deaths and make sure that no one else would suffer the same fate. I traveled the world, learning from the greatest martial artists and minds in the world. I returned home to Gotham City and used my skills to fight crime and injustice.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="text-center">
            I have fought against some of the most notorious criminals in the city - from the terrifying Scarecrow to the menacing Joker. Along the way, I have assembled a team of allies, such as Commissioner Gordon, Alfred Pennyworth, and Robin. I have also gained access to some of the most advanced technology in the world, which I use to protect the citizens of Gotham City.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="text-center">
            No matter the danger, I am always ready to face it. I may not have superpowers, but I have the courage and determination to stand up against evil.
